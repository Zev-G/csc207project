## Project Purpose
Our project is a game that tests people's knowledge of the UofT campus in a fun and engaging way.
This game provides two modes: a social multiplayer mode, where users can compete among friends, and a solo mode for users who want a more peaceful experience.
University life can be intense, so we wanted to help alleviate the pressure by embracing the wonderful architecture around UofT and promoting the discovery of ne places on campus.

We wanted to create a fun experience, accessible to all students, faculty and staff at the University of Toronto's St George Campus. Our app was designed to reinforce a sense of belonging and community among both students and faculty.

## Installation Instructions
see a full installation demonstration [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q2dFMJ-VL90z7lydPBLKgowK4025Bxwd/view?usp=sharing)
to see how to install java and our app

### Software Requirements
- **Operating System**: This application runs on any operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- **Java Version**:
    - Recommended: [Latest version of Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).
    - Minimum Requirement: Java version 22 or later.

### Instructions
To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Project**
    - Visit the [Release Page](https://github.com/Zev-G/csc207project/releases/tag/0.1-b.1).
    - Download the file named `csc207project_jar.zip`.

2. **Install Java**
    - Ensure that Java is installed on your system. If it is not installed, download and install the [latest version of Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/). Any version 22 or later is sufficient.
    - To verify your Java installation, open a terminal or command prompt and run:
      ```bash
      java -version
      ```
    - This should display the Java version. If the command fails, ensure Java is properly installed and added to your system's PATH.

3. **Extract the ZIP File**
    - Locate the downloaded file `csc207project_jar.zip` and extract its contents to a directory of your choice.
    - Inside the extracted directory, you should see a file named `csc207project.jar`.

4. **Run the Application**
    - Open a terminal or command prompt.
    - Navigate to the directory where `csc207project.jar` is located, or provide the full path to the file.
    - Run the application using the following command:
      ```bash
      java -jar path_to_csc207project.jar
      ```
      Replace `path_to_csc207project.jar` with the actual path to the `csc207project.jar` file.



### Common Issues and Troubleshooting

- **'java' is not recognized as an internal or external command**
    - **Cause**: Java is not installed or not added to the system's PATH.
    - **Solution**: Add Java to the PATH environment variable.
        - **Windows**:
          ```cmd
          setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-22\bin"
          ```
          Replace `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-22\bin` with the actual path to the `bin` directory of your Java installation.
        - **Linux/macOS**:
          ```bash
          export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/java/bin
          ```
          Replace `/path/to/java/bin` with the actual path to the `bin` directory of your Java installation.
        - Verify the installation by running:
          ```bash
          java -version
          ```

- **Unsupported Java Version**
    - **Cause**: A Java version older than 22 is installed.
    - **Solution**: Check your installed version:
      ```bash
      java -version
      ```
      Expected output:
      ```plaintext
      java version "22.0.1"
      Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 22.0.1+9)
      Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 22.0.1+9, mixed mode)
      ```
      If the version is older, download and install the latest version from the [Java Downloads page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).

- **Permission Denied**
    - **Cause**: Lack of execution permissions on Unix-based systems.
    - **Solution**: Grant execution permissions to the `.jar` file:
      ```bash
      chmod +x csc207project.jar
      ```
      Then run the application:
      ```bash
      java -jar csc207project.jar
      ```
      If necessary, use `sudo`:
      ```bash
      sudo java -jar csc207project.jar
      ```

- **Running the Application from a Different Directory**
    - **Solution**: Provide the full path to the `.jar` file:
      ```bash
      java -jar /absolute/path/to/csc207project.jar
      ```
      For example:
      ```bash
      java -jar C:\Users\YourUsername\Downloads\csc207project.jar
      ```

- **Checking the PATH Environment Variable**
    - **Solution**: Print the current PATH variable to confirm if Java is included:
        - **Windows**:
          ```cmd
          echo %PATH%
          ```
        - **Linux/macOS**:
          ```bash
          echo $PATH
          ```
        - Look for the path to Java (e.g., `/usr/local/java/jdk-22/bin`). If itâ€™s missing, add it as described above.



### Additional Notes

To play a solo game, click the Play button to start immediately. The game consists of 10 rounds of location guessing. For each round, you will see a picture and use an interactive map to select the location you believe the picture was taken. Confirm your guess by clicking the Guess button. Be mindful of the timer, as the game ends if it runs out before all rounds are completed. Points are awarded based on how close your guess is to the actual location. At the end of the game, you can return to the main menu with the Home button or view a game summary with the Summary button.
