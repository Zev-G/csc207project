## Project Purpose
Our project is a game that tests peoples knowledge of the UofT campus in a fun and engaging way.
This game provides two fun experiences by including a social multiplayer mode, where users can compete among friends, and a solo mode for users who want a more peaceful experience.
University life can be intense, so we wanted to help alleviate the pressure by embracing the beauty and promoting the discovery of our campus.

We wanted to create a fun experience, accessible to all students, faculty and staff at the University of Toronto's St George Campus. Our goal was to cut through the seriousness of University life and bring out the fun aspects of being part of this institution. Our app was designed to reinforce a sense of belonging and community among both students and faculty.

## Usage Guide
When first launching the app, you will be prompted to log in or sign up. To create an account, enter a username, password, and email address (NOT SURE SINCE NOT YET IMPLEMENTED). After logging in, you will be directed to the main page where the app's functionalities are accessible.

On the main page, you will find navigation buttons:
- **Play**: Start a solo game.
- **Multiplayer**: Challenge another player in multiplayer mode.
- **Account**: Manage your account details and view your statistics.
- **Upload Image**: Add your own photos to the game.

To play a solo game, click the Play button to start immediately. The game consists of 10 rounds of location guessing. For each round, you will see a picture and use an interactive map to select the location you believe the picture was taken. Confirm your guess by clicking the Guess button. Be mindful of the timer, as the game ends if it runs out before all rounds are completed. Points are awarded based on how close your guess is to the actual location. At the end of the game, you can return to the main menu with the Home button or view a game summary with the Summary button.

In multiplayer mode, you and your opponent each enter your usernames to start the game. Gameplay is the same as solo mode, but at the end, you can see both players' scores and the winner based on total points.

In the Account section, you can view your account details, delete your account, and check your statistics such as total points, games played, and correct guesses.

To upload your own images, click the Upload Image button. Add a photo of a UofT location, select the corresponding location on the interactive map, and upload it. Your image will then be available for use in both solo and multiplayer games.
